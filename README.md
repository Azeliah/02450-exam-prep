# 02450 Exam Preparation

This repository will contain a number of Jupyter notebooks covering the computational aspect of the course 02450 Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Mining.

Each notebook will cover a chapter in the beginning. This might result in redundant code. 
In time, this might be converted to a regular Python project to address the issue of redundancy.

Ideally, the code snippets in this project should be able to solve exam questions with new data. Exam questions will be used for testing.
